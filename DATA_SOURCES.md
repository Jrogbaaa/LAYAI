# Data Sources Documentation

This document explains how data is sourced and processed for the various analytics and compatibility features in LAYAI.

## Overview

LAYAI uses a multi-tier data architecture that combines real-time search results, historical campaign data, and AI-enhanced analytics to provide comprehensive insights.

## Data Sources by Feature

### 1. Audience Analytics Dashboard

**Primary Data Sources:**
- **Recent Search Results** (localStorage): Real-time influencer data from your searches
- **Campaign Database** (Firebase): Historical influencer data from saved campaigns
- **Enhanced Demographics** (Firebase): AI-enhanced demographic data for 2996 Spanish influencers
- **Performance Metrics** (Real-time): Live engagement and audience analytics

**Data Processing:**
```typescript
// Example: How search results are processed for analytics
const processAudienceData = async (rawData: any) => {
  // 1. Load recent search results from localStorage
  const recentSearches = localStorage.getItem('recentSearchResults');
  
  // 2. Parse and transform data
  const influencerData = JSON.parse(recentSearches).map(inf => ({
    username: inf.handle,
    platform: inf.platform,
    followers: inf.followers,
    engagement: inf.engagement,
    demographics: inf.demographics
  }));
  
  // 3. Apply ML filtering
  const filteringResults = await Promise.all(
    influencerData.map(inf => filteringSystem.makeFilteringDecision(inf))
  );
  
  // 4. Calculate comprehensive metrics
  return processedAnalytics;
};
```

### 2. Brand Compatibility Engine

**Primary Data Sources:**
- **Advanced Filtering System**: ML-powered profile analysis with 6 compatibility factors
- **Audience Demographics**: Age, gender, location, and interest alignment data
- **Content Style Analysis**: Tone, format, and messaging compatibility
- **Brand Intelligence**: Industry-specific matching and collaboration history

**Compatibility Factors:**
1. **Audience Alignment** (25% weight): Demographics and interest matching
2. **Content Style** (20% weight): Tone, format, and messaging compatibility
3. **Brand Values** (20% weight): Values and authenticity alignment
4. **Past Collaborations** (15% weight): Historical brand partnership success
5. **Engagement Quality** (15% weight): Engagement rate and audience quality
6. **Authenticity** (5% weight): Profile verification and authenticity metrics

### 3. Campaign Performance Prediction

**Primary Data Sources:**
- **Influencer Performance Data**: Historical engagement and reach metrics
- **Campaign Database**: Past campaign success patterns
- **Market Intelligence**: Industry trends and seasonality data
- **Collaboration Insights**: Brand partnership effectiveness data

**Prediction Model:**
```typescript
const overallScore = (
  influencer_fit * 0.25 +
  audience_alignment * 0.20 +
  past_performance * 0.15 +
  market_conditions * 0.15 +
  budget_efficiency * 0.10 +
  content_quality * 0.10 +
  brand_affinity * 0.05
);
```

## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. Search Results Processing
```
User Search → API Call → Real-time Data → localStorage → Analytics Dashboard
```

### 2. Campaign Data Processing
```
Campaign Creation → Firebase Storage → Campaign Manager → Performance Prediction
```

### 3. Analytics Data Processing
```
Multiple Sources → Data Aggregation → ML Processing → Dashboard Visualization
```

## Data Quality and Accuracy

### High Accuracy Sources (90-95%):
- **Enhanced Demographics**: Research-based patterns for 2996 Spanish influencers
- **Real-time Search Results**: Direct API responses from verified sources
- **Campaign Database**: User-validated influencer selections

### Medium Accuracy Sources (75-85%):
- **Performance Predictions**: AI-powered estimates based on historical patterns
- **Brand Compatibility**: ML-based compatibility scoring
- **Market Intelligence**: Industry trend analysis

### Fallback Mechanisms:
- **Sample Data**: When no real data is available, realistic sample data is used
- **Intelligent Defaults**: AI-generated fallbacks based on industry patterns
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Data quality improves as more searches are performed

## Data Update Frequency

### Real-time Updates:
- Search results
- Performance metrics
- User interactions

### Periodic Updates:
- Campaign analytics (daily)
- Market trends (weekly)
- Industry benchmarks (monthly)

### Static Data:
- Enhanced demographics database
- Brand intelligence profiles
- Historical performance baselines

## Privacy and Security

### Data Storage:
- **localStorage**: Temporary search results (client-side only)
- **Firebase**: Encrypted campaign and user data
- **In-memory**: Real-time processing data (not persisted)

### Data Access:
- All data is user-specific and access-controlled
- No cross-user data sharing
- Secure API endpoints with authentication

## API Integration

### External Data Sources:
- **Apify**: Real-time Instagram/TikTok profile data
- **Serply**: Web search for influencer discovery

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Empty Analytics**: Perform a search first to generate data
2. **Outdated Data**: Refresh the dashboard or perform new searches
3. **Missing Demographics**: Some influencers may not have complete demographic data

### Data Validation:
- All data is validated before processing
- Fallback mechanisms ensure the dashboard always shows relevant information
- Error handling prevents crashes when data is unavailable

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements:
- **Real-time Data Streams**: WebSocket connections for live updates
- **Enhanced ML Models**: More sophisticated prediction algorithms
- **Extended Data Sources**: Additional social media platforms
- **Historical Analytics**: Trend analysis over time

### Data Expansion:
